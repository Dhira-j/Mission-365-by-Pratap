## 🛠️ What I Implemented (JavaScript)
- Added **time-based greetings** (Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night)
- Implemented **availability status badge** based on:
  - Working days (Monday–Saturday)
  - Working hours (11 AM – 10 PM)
- Used conditional logic and DOM manipulation to update UI dynamically
- Improved code readability and logic flow

### 🌟 Reflection
Day 4 focused on applying JavaScript to real UI behavior. Outreach again exceeded the target (12 vs. 5). The 60-minute skill session was used to implement practical logic instead of theory. The project now feels more dynamic and closer to a real client-ready demo. Consistency and discipline were maintained throughout the day.
