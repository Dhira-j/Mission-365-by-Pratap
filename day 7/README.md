## 🛠️ What I Implemented (JavaScript)  
- Created a **form element** with input fields (e.g., name, email, message).  
- Added **basic validation** (required fields, email format check).  
- Used **event listeners** (`submit`, `input`) to handle user interaction.  
- Dynamically displayed **error messages** or success confirmation.  
- Ensured clean UI integration with existing project structure.

### 🌟 Reflection  
Day 5 built on the momentum of Day 4. Outreach again exceeded the target (11 vs. 5).  
The skill session was practical, focusing on form creation and validation — a core web dev skill that makes the project more interactive and user-friendly.  
Discipline was maintained, and the project now feels closer to a functional prototype that could be demoed to real users.
