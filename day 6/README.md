### 🌟 Reflection  
Day 6 was a reminder that **productivity isn’t just about numbers**.  
Yes, 14 DMs were sent — but the real challenge was **emotional reaction**.  

In sales, the moment attachment shows, **authority drops**.  
Today, I understood this truth.  

Mission 365 is not only about doing tasks —  
it’s about **controlling reactions** and staying centered.  

Tomorrow, I will return to the **process**,  
not chase the **lead**.
