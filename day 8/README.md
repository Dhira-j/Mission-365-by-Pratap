### 🌟 Reflection  
Day 8 built on the momentum of earlier progress. Outreach again exceeded the target (11 vs. 5).  
The skill session was practical, focusing on form creation, validation, and now **theme customization** — making the project more interactive and user-friendly.  
Discipline was maintained, and the project now feels closer to a functional prototype that could be demoed to real users. The addition of a **Dark Theme** makes the UI more polished and modern.
