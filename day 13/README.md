### 🌟 Reflection  
Day 12 marked a strong execution streak — hitting the **outreach target exactly (12/12)** and completing a practical skill task.  
The web development session was highly productive, focusing on **data persistence and validation** — a crucial step toward building real-world applications.  
The form implementation with localStorage not only improved technical depth but also enhanced project usability.  
Discipline was maintained, reinforcing consistency in both productivity and focus.  

This day’s build feels like a **mini CRM prototype**, combining user input, validation, and storage — a big leap toward scalable project features. 🚀
