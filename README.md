# ⚔️ Mission 365 by Pratap

This repository documents my **365-day execution challenge**.

No fake motivation.  
No highlight reels.  
Only daily action, tracking, and improvement — from zero.

## 🎯 What is Mission 365?

**Mission 365** is a personal discipline challenge where I commit to:

- Daily outreach (clients, connections, real conversations)
- Daily skill-building (Web Development)
- Daily build tasks (small → advanced)
- Strict discipline tracking (time, focus, phone usage)
- Honest night updates (wins + failures)

This repo is my **public execution log**.

## 📅 Daily Structure

Each day follows the same structure:

### ✅ Outreach
- Fixed number of DMs (starting small, increasing gradually)
- Focus on consistency, not motivation

### ✅ Skill
- Minimum 60 minutes of Web Development
- No skipping, no binge-learning

### ✅ Build
- One practical task per day
- Tasks progress from basic → advanced
