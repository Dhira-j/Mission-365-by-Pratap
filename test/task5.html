                MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
                WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM
                IF YOU LIVE IN (OR IF YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE BINDING
                ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 11. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.
                Thank you for choosing Microsoft!
                Depending on how you obtained the Windows software, this is a license agreement between (i) you and the
                device manufacturer or software installer that distributes the software with your device; or (ii) you
                and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live or, if a business, where your principal place of
                business is located, one of its affiliates) if you acquired the software from a retailer. Microsoft is
                the device manufacturer for devices produced by Microsoft or one of its affiliates, and Microsoft is the
                retailer if you acquired the software directly from Microsoft. If you are a volume license customer, use
                of this software is subject to your volume license agreement rather than this agreement.
                This agreement describes your rights, obligations, and the conditions upon which you may use the Windows
                software. You should review the entire agreement, including any supplemental license terms that
                accompany the software and any linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create
                this agreement that applies to you. You can review linked terms by pasting the (aka.ms/) link into a
                browser window.
                By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of these terms, and consent to the
                transmission of certain information during activation and during your use of the software as per the
                privacy statement described in Section 3. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not
                use the software or its features. You may contact the device manufacturer or installer, or your retailer
                if you purchased the software directly, to determine its return policy and return the software or device
                for a refund or credit under that policy. You must comply with that policy, which might require you to
                return the software with the entire device on which the software is installed for a refund or credit, if
                any.
                1.      Overview.
                a.      Applicability. This agreement applies to the Windows software that is preinstalled on your
                device, or acquired from a retailer and installed by you, the media on which you received the software
                (if any), any fonts, icons, images or sound files included with the software, and also any Microsoft
                updates, upgrades, supplements or services for the software, unless other terms come with them. It also
                applies to Windows apps developed by Microsoft that provide functionality such as mail, contacts, music
                and photos that are included with and are a part of Windows. If this agreement contains terms regarding
                a feature or service not available on your device, those terms do not apply.
                b.      Additional terms. Additional Microsoft and third-party terms may apply to your use of certain
                features, services and apps, depending on your device’s capabilities, how it is configured, and how you
                use it. Please read them.
                (i)      Some Windows apps provide an access point to, or rely on, online services, and the use of those
                services is sometimes governed by separate terms and privacy policies, such as the Microsoft Services
                Agreement at https://aka.ms/msa. You can view these terms and policies by looking at the service terms
                of use or the app’s settings, as applicable. The services may not be available in all regions.
                (ii)     Microsoft, or the device manufacturer or installer may include additional apps, which will be
                subject to separate license terms and privacy policies.
                (iii)    The software may include third-party programs that are licensed to you under this agreement, or
                under their own terms. License terms, notices and acknowledgements, if any, for the third-party programs
                can be viewed at https://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices.
                (iv)     To the extent included with Windows, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote are licensed for your
                personal, non-commercial use, unless you have commercial use rights under a separate agreement.
                2.      Installation and Use Rights.
                a.      License. The software is licensed, not sold. Under this agreement, we grant you the right to
                install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device), for use by one person
                at a time, so long as you comply with the terms and restrictions contained in this agreement. Updating
                or upgrading from non-genuine software with software from Microsoft or authorized sources does not make
                your original version or the updated/upgraded version genuine, and in that situation, you do not have a
                license to use the software.
                b.      Device. In this agreement, “device” means a local hardware system (whether physical or virtual)
                with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is
                considered to be a device. For purposes of this agreement, “device” does not include any hardware system
                (whether physical or virtual) on which the software is installed or accessed solely for remote use over
                a network.
                c.      Restrictions. The device manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all rights (such as
                rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement and no other rights are
                licensed to you. For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not give you any right to, and you may
                not (and you may not permit any other person or entity to):
                (i)      use or virtualize features of the software separately;
                (ii)     publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the software;
                (iii)    transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement);
                (iv)    work around any technical restrictions or limitations in the software;
                (v)     use the software as server software or to operate the device as a server, except as permitted
                under Section 2(d)(iii) below; use the software to offer commercial hosting services; make the software
                available for simultaneous use by more than one user over a network, except as permitted under Section
                2(d)(vi) below; install the software on a server for remote access or use over a network; or install the
                software on a device for use only by remote users
